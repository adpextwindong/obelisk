# playfuljs_raycaster_stripped_down

A minimal example of dda stuff from the playfuljs examples.

There is still some wall height handling code. Like it doesn't terminate on hitting just a wall, it terminates on a draw distance parameter.

Ideally I would like to make a more functional version that works that can be used for crosstesting against other versions.
